      <description>In this project, I tackled the pressing issue of antibiotic resistance by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict the efficacy of potential drug candidates in inhibiting β-lactamase, a key enzyme involved in antibiotic resistance. Using the ChEMBL dataset, I sourced canonical smiles of compounds known to interact with β-lactamase, which were then transformed into 2D images using RDKit for CNN input. By assigning labels based on pChEMBL values, compounds were categorized as either active (effective at inhibiting β-lactamase) or inactive.</description>
