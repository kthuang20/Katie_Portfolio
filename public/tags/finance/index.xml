      <description>This user interactive calculator is publically available on Streamlit at: https://compound-interest-calc.streamlit.app.&#xA;Compound Interest Equation Used:&#xA;I wanted to create a calculator to learn how compound interest works rather than simply plugging in the numbers into a website.&#xA;This web application allows the user to adjust the same parameters as on the website:&#xA;Initial deposit Contribution amount Contribution frequency Years of growth Estimated rate of return It also shows a scatter plot showing the total balance after each year with and without compound interest using the compound interest equation above.</description>
