I obtained my Bachelor's of Science in Biomedical Engineering at UMass Lowell and am currently working towards my Master's of Science in Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology there. I am a self-motivated learner and with a growth mindset who is passionate and adept at computational problem solving and leveraging statistical methods in Python to build data-driven models aimed at helping develop more effective treatments for patients.
