# Overview
*A [password generator](https://simple-password-generator.streamlit.app) aimed at creating complex passwords that are
easy to remember using user's input.*

# Motivation
Often when I create my own passwords, I like to use short songs or phrases
to generate my passwords by replacing letter with symbols that resemble each letter.
This makes it easier to remember in my mind than using software to randomly
generate passwords.

# How It Works
Simply type in the text that you want to use to generate your password and click the
"Generate Password" button.

# Source Code
This GitHub repository contains the following files:
* `app.py` â€“ *code used to generate the streamlit web app*
* `source/generate_password.py` - *code used to generated password*
* `tests/test_generate_passwords.py` - *code used to test methods in `generate_password.py`*
