title: "Exploring the Genetic Effects of Wnt Pathway on Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
---

As the final project for my Cancer Genomics class, I analyzed the effects of genes in the Wnt pathway on TCGA data on Pancreatic Adenocarncinoma generated by the PanCancer Atlas. The Jupyter notebook walks through all the steps that were taken to clearn the data, analyze it, and obtain all values and visualizations. I also go through the scientific method, using the results I have gathered to ask a follow up question, develop a hypothesis, and test this hypothesis.
