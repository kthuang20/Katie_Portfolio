**Compound Interest Equation Used:**

![](https://sqy7rm.media.zestyio.com/Compound-Interest-Formula-Mobile.png)


I wanted to create a calculator to learn how compound interest works rather than simply plugging in the numbers into a website.

This web application allows the user to adjust the same parameters as on the website:
* Initial deposit
* Contribution amount
* Contribution frequency
* Years of growth
* Estimated rate of return

It also shows a scatter plot showing the total balance after each year with and without compound interest using the compound interest equation above.

Adjusting any of the parameters will automatically adjust the results in the figure.

The source code for this dashboard is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/kthuang20/CompoundInterestCalc
